LolProject
==========

Purpose is to grab data from Riot's API and store the data so that it can be viewed later. This is now a dead project. Riot changed their API so that the data given does not hold the same value as it did when I first started using the API. The API is now focused more on Pro compitions. I might look at it again in the future but I would start it as a new project.
