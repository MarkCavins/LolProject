          	<p> Welcome to Pre-Season! Going into the last month I almost considered abandoning my 4th Season goal and going back into ranked. Then I went on a 2 week 
          		streak where I averaged 1 win to every 6 losses. If this had been in ranked I would have said this is because of the scramble for everyone to get out of
          		their current Division. But this was Normals so I didn't get it. Suffice to say I stayed in normals and lost my lovely silver border. So Sad. </p>
          	
          	<p> But now is the time where Riot introduces most of the changes for the next season and JOY an update to the map. As of yet I don't have a goal except to
          		further work on support mechanics. I will be focusing more on non-traditional supports and champs that I can use to carry a game in case the lane partner 
          		is not up to the task.</p>
          	
          	<ul>
          	<h3>Starting Goal</h3>
          		<li>4.00 KDA - 3.00 was too easy to obtain so going for 4.</li>
          		<li>Have more kills than deaths - Last season I let my assists carry my KDA. That only works when your team is getting kills</li>
          		<li>Place 30 wards per game as a support. 15 as any other lane - I saw that when I did not play as a support the guy who did thought 
          			other items were more important than wards. So if they can't be up to the task I need to buy more wards. I probably need to buy
          			more wards anyways. vision is key.</li>
