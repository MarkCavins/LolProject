          	<h4 class="page-header">About Me</h4>
          	 <p>I am a 
          		father of 2 who enjoys playing League of Legends while the rest of the family is asleep. While being a casual in the game, that 
          		does not make me in any way less passionate about my progress. In season three I got as high as Silver 4. By the end 
          		of the season however I was at only a 39% win average. I could make all the excuses that I wanted but the truth is that with a few 
          		exception of some troll teams my loses were my fault. Bad positioning, going to agressive without propper vision, and playing champs 
          		I had played only a few games with in Normals. Couple that with the fact that in July 2013 I found out that I was having my second son 
          		and my head wasn't really in it. Riot payed me back when I went into Season 4. After posting a 5/5 placing I was put into Bronze. 
          		After my son came 6 weeks early I settled into fatherhood and promptly decayed into Bronze 5.</p>
          	<h4 class="page-header">The Plan</h4>
          	<p>Rather than try to climb my way up through ranked I had a moment of clarity. I would spend the rest of the season having fun and 
          		working on a role (support) that I could really get good at. So being a numbers kind of person I decided to look at Riot's API and 
          		start making a dashboard that I could track my game progress. I would set a goal and with that goal in mind go into each game 
          		focussing on the game play to make that goal a reality. </p>
          	<p>On the dashboard page you will find all of the games that I have played since mid June (when I became active again). What I will try 
          		to provide on a consistant basis is My KDA, Kills, Deaths, Assists and other game data to show my progress towards my goal. Could I 
          		get all this data from LolKing or some site like that? Sure I could but 10 games at a time is misleading. I like to look at progress 
          		over time. Is my Average KDA getting better or worse? Am I forgetting to place enough wards? Do I consistantly have more deaths than 
          		kills? All these things we know contribute to bad games but sometimes forget when EZ is flaming you all game.</p>
          	<p>The last things I plan to provide is comments and video highlights for each game. This could be more challenging for both the time and 
          		the fact that it is always hard to point out your failings than it is to highlight your sucesses. But as with all goals it is the 
          		work that you put in that helps you achive those goals.</p>
